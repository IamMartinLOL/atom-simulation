[14.11 2025] – Added orbital switching using F1–F5 keys
- Implemented switching between d-orbitals (d_z2, d_x2-y2, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz)
- Added 'currentOrbital' variable and 'orbitalChanged' flag to track changes
- Updated probability_3d_z2() function to support all five d-orbitals
- Added logic in key_callback() to handle orbital switching and set orbitalChanged = true
- In the main render loop, the electron cloud is re-sampled via sampleCloud_3d_z2() when the orbital changes
- Result: the probability cloud dynamically updates when pressing F1–F5

[06.12 2025] - I modified the visualization of electrons, protons, and neutrons. At the same time, I made the movement of the atomic nucleus more realistic and adjusted the distances to make it as realistic as possible.
I played around with the electrons a bit, so I apologize for any errors or bugs. 
I modified the code so that you can set everything yourself (color, number of samples, speed of movement, etc.).
